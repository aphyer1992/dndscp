you think that we predictably will act in foolish ways?
you think our Art has played no part in where you are today?
our scarlet King whose Name we bring has made the game you play
upon this earth He speaks in birth, His Words set forth our Way
He speaks of she who's yet to be who now brings forth the Doom
a flower torn and yet unborn, an iris yet to bloom
a wilful, wild darkling child, a scarlet holy womb
the seventh bride who time and tide have taken from her Groom
